Time Series is an Awesome platform to work with. Stock data is a fantastic sector of time-series analytics. 
After years of study by researchers and finance experts on stock market prediction; 
there is no definite method that seems to predict stock price both accurately and is long-lasting at the same time. 
This is due to the uncertain behavior of stock movement and numerous parameters that take part in deciding market performance. 
Lots of techniques have been examined for stock market price prediction.

# LSTM vs ARIMA

The nonlinear deep learning algorithm can better reflect the changeable internal laws and external relations of data;
especially for complex stock price data. Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) is a special algorithm for processing time-series problem.
In this work, a stationary analysis of the stock's time-series data and then used the LSTM neural network algorithm to predict stock data under different stationary conditions, 
and performed statistical analysis on multiple experimental data. In addition, an ARIMA algorithm was introduced to compare with the LSTM. 
A large number of experimental results show that the LSTM neural network prediction algorithm has higher prediction accuracy and is not sensitive to the stability response.
